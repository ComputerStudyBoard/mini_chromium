mini_chromium

This is mini_chromium, a small collection of useful low-level ("base")
routines from the Chromium open-source project at
http://www.chromium.org/ . Chromium is large, sprawling, full of
dependencies, and a web browser. mini_chromium is small, self-contained,
and a library. mini_chromium is especially useful as a dependency of
other code that wishes to use Chromium's base routines. By using
mini_chromium, other projects' code can function in a standalone
environment outside of Chromium without having to treat all of Chromium
as a dependency. When building as part of Chromium, those projects' code
can use Chromium's own (non-mini_chromium) base implementation.

Code provided in mini_chromium provides the same interface as the
equivalent code in Chromium. One major difference is that
"base/basictypes.h" does not provide its own precise-width integral
types such as int8 and uint64. To use mini_chromium, use <stdint.h>
types such as int8_t and uint64_t. See http://crbug.com/138542 and
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/chromium-dev/zFzvBFptJj4/ .
Another major difference is that no attempt at Windows support has been
provided.
